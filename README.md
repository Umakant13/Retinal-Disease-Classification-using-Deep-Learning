Introduction

Retinal diseases can lead to severe vision impairment and blindness if not detected early. This project aims to aid in the early detection and classification of retinal diseases using deep learning techniques. By training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a large dataset of retinal images, we can classify images into different disease categories with high accuracy.

Features

Automated Image Classification: Classify retinal images into multiple disease categories.
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use interface for loading images and viewing predictions.
Visualization: Visualize the classification results and model performance.

Installation
Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository:

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Retinal-Disease-Classification.git
cd Retinal-Disease-Classification

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To classify retinal images using the trained model, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset: Place your retinal images in a folder, for example images/.

Run the classification script:

bash
Copy code
python classify.py --image_folder images/
View the results: The script will output the classification results for each image in the specified folder.

Dataset
The model is trained on a publicly available retinal disease dataset. You can download the dataset from Kaggle or use your own dataset. Ensure your dataset is organized as follows:

bash
Copy code
dataset/
│
├── train/
│   ├── disease1/
│   ├── disease2/
│   └── ...
│
└── test/
    ├── disease1/
    ├── disease2/
    └── ...
Model
The deep learning model used in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The architecture includes multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to achieve high classification accuracy.

Results
The model achieves high accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying retinal diseases. Below are some performance metrics:

Accuracy: 95%
Precision: 94%
Recall: 93%
F1 Score: 94%
You can visualize the training and validation accuracy and loss by running the following command:
